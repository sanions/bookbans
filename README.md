# bookbans

**Unsupervised notes:** Started with all with all of the school districts in the US. Then created a binary varible for book bans and marked the districts that practiced it. 

Merged in LEAID to county and then county to political leaning. This gives us school district to political leaning. Lastly, I merged in academic success as another predictor.
